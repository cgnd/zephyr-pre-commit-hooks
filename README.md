# zephyr-pre-commit-hooks

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cgnd/zephyr-pre-commit-hooks)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cgnd/zephyr-pre-commit-hooks)

A collection of pre-commit hooks for use with [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).

Check out https://cgnd.dev/posts/enforce-zephyr-code-quality-pre-commit/ for a deep dive into using pre-commit in Zephyr applications.

## Using zephyr-pre-commit-hooks with pre-commit

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/cgnd/zephyr-pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.0.0 # Use the ref you want to point at
    hooks:
    - id: zephyr-checkpatch-diff
```

## Hooks available

### `zephyr-checkpatch-diff`

This hook runs the `${ZEPHYR_BASE}/scripts/checkpatch.pl` script on any C source file changes staged in the git index (i.e. it only checks the output of `git diff --cached` and does not check entire files). As a result, trying to run `checkpatch.pl` against all existing files in a repository using the command `pre-commit run --all-files` will NOT work.

> **Note**
>
> This hook depends on `${ZEPHYR_BASE}` environment variable to be set. Make sure to run `source <zephyr>/zephyr-env.sh` as described in [Zephyr Environment Scripts](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#zephyr-environment-scripts).
